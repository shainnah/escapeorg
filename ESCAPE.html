        <p>ESCAPE, short for (E)xtended (S)ervices and (C)are (Ap)proach for (E)veryone, was created mainly for reaching out those people who are incapable of consulting medical professionals due to factors including financial problems and lack of accessibility or knowledge about the importance of seeking health care. Being a non-profit organization, it targets to deliver the right and quality assistance for those residents living in community area around Quezon Province and even those who are living on the streets, being exposed to various risks of diseases. More so, it will be one of the sources to help people "escape" the struggling healthcare system of the country.
